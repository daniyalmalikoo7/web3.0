WEB 3.0

# What is web3.0?

While web 2.0 might look like an advanced approach to the internet, it still harbors many setbacks. What about the security of your personal data? Trusted institutions take control over the data of users in Web 2.0, especially due to the need for trusted intermediaries.

If two parties want to complete a transaction and they don’t know or trust each other, then they would have to rely on trusted intermediaries. However, the intermediary has control over the data storage and management thereby strengthening their grip over users.In addition, centralized power has never gone well in times of crisis thereby calling for decentralization.

The latter player in the question of “what is the difference between web 2.0 and web 3.0?” has a promising solution to the setbacks in web 2.0.

- Web 3.0 presents a promising improvement over Web 2.0, especially with major transformations in terms of infrastructure. Also referred to as the semantic web, the third generation of the web leverages an advanced metadata system. The metadata system helps in structuring and arranging all types of data for making it readable for humans and machines. The foremost advantage associated with Web 3.0 is practically the best highlight in Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 differences. Web 3.0 takes away the need for centralized intermediaries and introduced the universality of information.

# What is DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology)

For starters, DLT stands for Distributed Ledger Technology. It is also known as a “shared ledger” or simply distributed ledger.

It is a digital system that lets users and systems record transactions related to assets. A distributed ledger technology stores the information at multiple locations at any given point of time.

DLT, unlike traditional databases, does not have any central place to store information. This is what differentiates it from a traditional database. The decentralization feature also provides better security, transparency, and trust among parties using it.

So, where DLT originates from?
At the core, DLT originates from the peer-to-peer(P2P) network. In any P2P network, peers communicate with each other without the need for a centralized entity. Technically, a distributed ledger technology is possible through a peer-to-peer network. A consensus algorithm is utilized to make decentralization work.

Right now, distributed ledger technologies are very popular. After all, they are changing the land space of different industries out there. One of the technologies that are under the umbrella of DLT is blockchain.
